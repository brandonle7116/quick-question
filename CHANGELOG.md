- Smart compilation stack: tykit (HTTP) → Editor trigger → batch mode fallback
- tykit — HTTP server inside Unity Editor for AI agent control
- Codex Review Gate — blocks edits while review verification is pending
- Skill review enforcement — Stop hook blocks session end until `/qq:self-review` runs
- Smart handoff between skills with `--auto` mode for full pipeline execution

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now copies `scripts/hooks/` subdirectory
- `install.sh` output uses current skill names (`/qq:test`, `/qq:commit-push`)
- Duplicate scripts in tykit `Scripts~/` replaced with symlinks
- Review Gate documentation accuracy (`.cs` and `Docs/*.md`, not "all edits")
- Git added to Prerequisites (hard dependency)
- Claude-only review skills now read `AGENTS.md` for architecture rules
- `claude-plan-review` fallback glob excludes generated review artifacts
